# Bank-Account-Management-System
> Experience streamlined account management with this Java-based system. From creating and managing accounts to facilitating secure transactions, it boasts a robust testing framework ensuring reliability and thread-safe operations, all encapsulated within a single package.

Welcome to the Java Account Management System repository! This project provides a robust solution for managing accounts, facilitating essential functionalities such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and secure fund transfers.

## Features:
### Account Creation: Easily create new accounts with user-defined attributes.
### Transaction Management: Seamlessly deposit funds, withdraw amounts, and transfer funds between accounts.
### Concurrency Control: Utilizes synchronization mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency during concurrent transactions.
### Robust Testing Framework: Includes comprehensive unit tests to validate functionality and reliability under various scenarios.
Thread-Safe Operations: Implements thread-safe operations to handle multiple transactions concurrently without data corruption.
Technologies Used:
Java: Primary programming language for development.
JUnit (or custom testing framework): Facilitates the writing and execution of unit tests.
ConcurrentHashMap: Ensures thread-safe access to account data structures.
Build Automation (Maven or Gradle): Manages project dependencies and automates build processes.
Key Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Organizes code into reusable and maintainable components.
Concurrency Control: Ensures data consistency and integrity in multi-threaded environments.
Unit Testing: Validates the correctness and reliability of individual components.
Synchronization: Coordinates access to shared resources to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.
